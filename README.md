# Cryo-EM(/ET) data processing support_wiki
The purpose of this project is to gather information about resources, software pacakges and other scripts that I have found useful in my data processing support role.

**Go to the [Wiki](https://github.com/derpaule/cryoem_support_wiki/wiki) to access that information.** 

# Scripts
The folder [scripts](https://github.com/derpaule/cryoem_support_wiki/tree/main/scripts) contains some scripts that I have created with the help of AI coding bots.
The scripts are referred to in the Wiki.

# Documents
The Wiki refers to some documents which were added to this folder.

# Current role and academic background
Since 2023, I am working as a senior bioinformatician as part of the National Bioinformatics Infrastructure Sweden [NBIS](https://nbis.se/).
My support role is integrated in the [Swedish cryo-EM facility](https://www.scilifelab.se/units/cryo-em/), and together with my colleague,
[Piotr Draczkowski](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Piotr-Draczkowski), we support cryo-EM/ET users to process their datasets. 
Furthermore, we are involved in teaching and user consulting (drop-ins). 
My academic background is in cryo-EM, X-ray crystallography, protein biophysics and biochemistry. 
You can follow and/or contact me also via [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tim-Schulte-4) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tim-schulte-14405677).
